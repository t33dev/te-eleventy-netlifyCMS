  <h2>Community involvement</h2>

<p>Note: I took a bit of a break from community involvement between 2022-2025 where I was mostly focused on mentoring within my role at Atlassian, and then afterwards navigating both a job change and health issues.</p>

    <h3>Co-organiser at The F Factor: Tech Women</h3>
    <p> Early 2025 I joined <a

        href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/the-f-factor-tech-women/"
      >
        the F Factor's
      </a>
organising committee. Our purpose is to be a holistic support network for the entire duration of our members' technology careers. We want to see more women making it into technology leadership and fewer women exiting the sector, mid-career.</p>
<p>With a great team on board, we are back this year with our "Stronger Together" theme and some fantastic events and speakers to support a variety of careers, both in person in Sydney and online.</p>

    <h3>Girls in Tech Australia</h3>
    <p> Early 2023 I spoke at a Girls in Tech Australia event for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tarynewens_career-tech-engineering-activity-7043335496776777728-4Ycg">"A night with female leaders in engineering"</a>. It was a great opportunity to share on a variety of topics such as what inspired our career paths, how we manage competition in a highly competitive field and how we adapt to the fast pace environment of tech engineering.</p>

    <h3>The Purpose Project</h3>
    <p>
      At the end of 2021 I was able to participate in
      <a
        class="linkFeature"
        href="https://www.thepurposeproject.com.au/"
      >
        The Purpose Project
      </a>
      . I was involved in two workshops where I spoke to students about my career journey, with the goal to help them connect to meaningful careers.

    <h3>STEM x Play</h3>
    <p>
      In 2021 I volunteered with
      <a
        class="linkFeature"
        href="https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology/women-engineering-and-it/primary-and-high-school-programs/stem-x-play-primary-school-program"
      >
        UTS STEM x Play primary school program
      </a>
      . I had the pleasure of joining a primary school class as an
      industry professional mentor. The aim is to increase young girls
      interest, confidence and identity with STEM and was incredibly
      rewarding to be part of.

    <h3 className={utilStyles.h3}>General Assembly</h3>
    <p>
      I was previously regularly involved in the General Assembly software engineering
      community. I often make time for mentoring sessions with individual
      students, as well as other career changers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also used to present to software engineering classes at
      <a

      Sydney (and Melbourne once or twice!). I introduced them to CSS, the
      amazing things that can be created with it (think fun interactions
      and art!), and resources for them to continue learning more!
